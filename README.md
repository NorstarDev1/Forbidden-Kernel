## Key Plugins

This vault is supercharged with a number of powerful plugins:

- **`Dataview`**: The engine of the vault's data organization. It allows you to query and display data from your notes using SQL-like queries, creating dynamic tables, lists, and dashboards that automatically update as your notes change.
- **`Templater`**: The heart of the vault's content creation system. It allows you to create dynamic templates with variables, functions, and scripts, automating the creation of complex, pre-populated notes.
- **`Tasks`**: A robust task management system that allows you to track tasks across your entire vault. You can add due dates, priorities, recurrence, and filters to create powerful, customized task views.
- **`QuickAdd`**: Streamlines the creation of new notes and content by providing a quick-capture interface. This is perfect for getting ideas down quickly without breaking your flow.
- **`Periodic Notes`**: Automates the creation of daily, weekly, and monthly notes, providing a consistent structure for journaling, planning, and reflection.
- **`CardBoard`**: Allows you to create and manage Kanban boards within Obsidian, providing a visual way to track projects and workflows. This is used for the `Project Kanban Board.md`.

## Core Workflows

### Creating New Notes

1.  Use the **`QuickAdd`** plugin to quickly create a new note from a template.
2.  Choose the appropriate template from the **`001 Templates`** directory.
3.  Fill in the relevant information in the note's YAML frontmatter and content. The `Templater` plugin will automatically fill in fields like the creation date.
4.  Link the new note to other relevant notes in the vault to build your web of knowledge.

### Managing Projects with Project Specs

1.  Create a new project spec file in the **`062_Projects`** directory using the standardized project spec template.
2.  Fill out the YAML frontmatter with the project's metadata, such as the `status`, `owner`, and `target_date`.
3.  Define the project's mission, objectives, and components in the body of the note.
4.  Add specific, actionable tasks to the "Active Tasks" table.
5.  Track the progress of all projects visually using the [[Project Kanban Board]]. This board automatically pulls tasks from all your project spec files.
