# 🌌 SIVERSE Project Specification: SIVIO

> SIVIO is the Siverse I/O Connector — a modular system that captures, logs, and synchronizes chat-based messages between multiple human and agentic interfaces. It ensures persistent context, memory, and collaboration across the command line, user interfaces, and memory systems like Windsurf.

---

## 🧱 New Feature: Command Trigger Interface

### 🔑 Summary

Adds support for simple trigger commands (e.g. `/obsidian/get<File>`) that allow agents or humans to fetch, write, or query files from the vault directly through a chat or CLI input. Trigger words initiate system scripts that perform I/O actions on vault contents.

### ✨ Examples

```bash
/obsidian/get<SIVIO_Project_Spec>
/obsidian/write<Meeting_Notes_0802>::Final notes synced.
/obsidian/query<agent memory>
```

### 🔌 New Component: Trigger Command Layer

| Component           | Description                                | Tech Stack        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Trigger Interpreter | Parses `/obsidian/` style commands         | Bash / Regex      |
| Vault IO Dispatcher | Executes read/write/query tasks from vault | Node / Python     |
| Output Formatter    | Returns result as markdown into chat       | Markdown renderer |
| Access Control      | Ensures only authorized roles can write    | YAML Permissions  |

### 🔄 Integration Points

- Connected to CLI relay, chat frontend, agent interfaces
- Will update logs, notes, taskboards on demand
- May trigger alerts or visual indicators

### 🧪 Benefits

- Eliminates repetitive copy-paste between interfaces
- Enables rapid memory lookups and note writing
- Supports agent automation with full traceability

### 📁 Supporting Note

See: `[[SIVIO_Trigger_CheatSheet]]` (linked doc collecting all registered trigger commands and aliases)

## 📟 Documentation Protocol

To ensure that SIVIO is maintainable, debuggable, and reproducible across future deployments, we follow a consistent documentation protocol:

### 📚 Key Principles

- **Document-as-you-build**: Every function or feature must have a corresponding section in the spec or linked note.
- **Keep local + mirrored documentation**: Maintain canonical docs in Obsidian and sync to GitHub or a shared repo.
- **Self-describing code**: Where possible, include inline docstrings or config block headers.
- **Backlink relationships**: Link all major components (scripts, logs, outputs) to their respective specs using Obsidian links.

### 🛠 Required Artifacts per Component

| Artifact             | Required? | Format             |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| Spec Entry           | ✅         | Markdown + YAML    |
| Code File Reference  | ✅         | Inline links       |
| Example Usage        | ✅         | Codeblock          |
| Error Handling Notes | ⚠️        | Markdown/Checklist |
| Testing Notes / Logs | ✅         | Log File + Summary |

### 📦 Storage Locations

- Specs → `vault/specs/`
- Scripts → `vault/scripts/`
- Logs → `vault/logs/`
- Templates → `vault/templates/`

### 🔄 CI/CD Integration Considerations

- Every update to SIVIO should generate or modify changelogs (`changelog.md`)
- Include `README.md` task updates upon trigger creation or new system hook
- Automate test verification scripts into CI/CD where possible

## 🔄 Software Development Lifecycle Modules

A comprehensive outline of each SDLC phase SIVIO will follow:

### 1. 📊 Requirements & Discovery

- Capture human/agent pain points
- User stories and behavior triggers
- Vault query mappings

### 2. 🔠 System Architecture & Design

- Module diagrams
- Command routing map
- Trigger grammar schemas

### 3. 🛠️ Development

- Build modular scripts by feature
- Write tests alongside implementation
- Use `vault/scripts/` and `vault/test/`

### 4. 🔧 Testing & QA

- Manual walkthroughs
- Trigger regression tests
- Edge case simulations for async IO

### 5. ✉️ Documentation

- Update `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`
- Link feedback via feedback form template

### 6. ✨ Deployment & Integration

- Vault-to-Git sync
- Local ↔ remote command propagation
- Notification triggers

### 7. ⚖️ Maintenance & Feedback Loops

- Command deprecation handling
- Real-time feedback notes
- Vault prompt tuning from telemetry
