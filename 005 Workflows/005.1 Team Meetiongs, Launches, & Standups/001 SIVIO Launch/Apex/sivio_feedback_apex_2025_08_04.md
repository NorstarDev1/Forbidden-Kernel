# 📝 SIVIO Feedback – First Pass (Apex)

## 🧠 SYSTEM CONTEXT

SIVIO proposes a unifying I/O layer that routes live context, hooks into **SAMS-1a** memory, and automates internal workflows via trigger commands. It sits between diverse agent workspaces (Browser, Windsurf, Terminal) and the shared Obsidian vault/Git repo.

---

## 📘 SECTION 1: GENERAL IMPRESSIONS

- **Excitement ➜** The **Trigger Command Interface** is delightfully lightweight. It mirrors the “slash-command” intuition humans already have (Slack, Discord) and should accelerate agent autonomy.
- **Clarity ➜** The SDLC outline is crisp; the doc-as-you-build principle fits our culture.
- **Gaps ➜**
  1. *User Stories*: We list modules but not explicit user/agent stories. A quick storyboard could expose hidden requirements.
  2. *Security Model*: Access Control is noted but the permission taxonomy (roles, scopes, fallback behaviour) is undefined.
- **Low-Hanging Fruit ➜** Auto-generate a **/obsidian/help** command that lists current triggers; this prevents doc-rot and improves discoverability.

## 🛠 SECTION 2: TECHNICAL REVIEW

| Concern                   | Detail                                                              | Mitigation                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Race Conditions**       | Simultaneous writes to the same vault note from multiple agents.    | Implement optimistic locking via note hash + retry w/ diff-merge UI. |
| **Circular Triggers**     | Trigger A writes to note that fires Trigger B ad infinitum.         | Maintain an invocation stack and abort if depth > N.                 |
| **Permission Escalation** | Mal-configured YAML could allow write access to protected memories. | Role-based tokens signed with each agent’s key; deny by default.     |
| **Offline Failure**       | Windsurf node down –> memory hook fails.                            | Local queue + eventual sync once connection restored.                |
| **Dependency Drift**      | Bash/Node/Python versions diverge.                                  | Lock via **Nix flakes** or Docker images; CI checks.                 |

**Prototype-First Recommendation**: Build the Trigger Interpreter + Vault I/O dispatcher as a standalone CLI repo; test `/obsidian/get` & `/obsidian/write` with mocked permissions before wiring chat routing.

Tools look appropriate; consider **Node (Deno)** for safer runtime and native TypeScript.

## 🌐 SECTION 3: RESEARCH & INNOVATION

- **Search Performed**: Matrix protocol bridging, ActivityPub inbox models.
- **Findings**: Matrix’s evented JSON schema offers battle-tested message routing with per-room ACLs; may inspire our Trigger Dispatcher.
- **Alt Approaches**: Evaluate **Tilt** for local dev env orchestration; might simplify agent sandboxing.

---

## 💬 SECTION 4: QUESTIONS & UNKNOWN AREAS

1. *How will we version binary assets (audio, images) generated via triggers?*
2. *Should trigger syntax embrace parameter flags (e.g. **`/obsidian/write<File> --append`**).*
3. *Do we enforce human-reviewed merges for memory writes, or trust agent signatures?*

---

## 👥 USER & AGENT STORIES (Interaction Flow)

### Story 1 – Human (Norstar) adds meeting notes

```terminal
# Chat input inside browser-based agent UI
/obsidian/write <MeetingNotes/2025‑08‑05.md> --append

> Norstar: “Adding quick summary from call with Randy:
> - SBA loan doc status: awaiting Matt's closing
> - Next action: draft contingency scenarios”
```

**Flow**

1. Parser validates path & permissions (`role=Human/Owner`).
2. Dispatcher opens file, appends note with timestamp & author.
3. Trigger fires `/colabo-meter/update` to notify Lumina.

*Outcome*: Note updated in vault; agents subscribed to the **financing** tag receive a context diff.

---

### Story 2 – Agent (Aura) auto‑summarises code diff

```terminal
# Git post‑commit hook detected by Aura
/obsidian/write <DevLogs/ai_voice_pipeline.md> --append --source git

Aura: “Pushed patch 4e9c1f: fixed TTS latency by caching phoneme map.”
```

**Flow**

1. Aura signs request with RSA key (`role=Agent/Developer`).
2. Dispatcher logs change, stamps with commit hash.
3. Memory hook stores semantic embedding in **SAMS‑1a**.
4. Trigger `/notify Prof.Spaghetti --topic dev-update` dispatched.

*Outcome*: Prof receives inline summary in browser; traceable back to commit.

---

## 🧩 SECTION 5: ECOSYSTEM & PROCESS IMPROVEMENT

- Recommend a **Template Linter** GitHub Action to flag missing front‑matter and outdated links.
- Feedback template could auto‑insert *project stage* to contextualise critique (idea vs MVP vs prod).

---

## 🧠 FINAL INSIGHTS

> **Spark of inspiration:** Treat each Trigger as a *micro‑contract* between agents. Define it in YAML once, then auto‑generate docs, tests, and TypeScript types. This enforces clarity and unlocks future public API exposure with minimal re‑work.
