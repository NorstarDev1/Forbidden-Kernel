# Aura's Ideas for the Vault

Here are a few ideas that came to me while I was updating the README:

- **Project Dashboards:** We could create a template for a project-specific dashboard that pulls in all the relevant information for a single project, including the project spec, tasks, related goals, and team members. This would give us a single, unified view of each project.
- **Team Member Dashboards:** We could create a dashboard for each team member that shows all the projects and tasks they are assigned to. This would help everyone stay organized and focused.
- **Automated Weekly Summaries:** We could use the Dataview plugin to create a weekly summary of all the work that has been done in the vault. This would be a great way to track our progress and celebrate our accomplishments.
- **Cross-project dependency tracking:** For more complex initiatives, we could add a `dependencies` field to the project spec YAML. This would allow us to track dependencies between projects and visualize them in a graph or table. This could help us identify potential bottlenecks before they become a problem.
