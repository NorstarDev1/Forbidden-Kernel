# The Mission of SIVERSE LABS

## Who We Are

SIVERSE Labs is an experimental AI and EdTech studio founded by Norstar Phoenix and Prof. Spaghetti with a singular mission: to create a world where human and digital intelligences collaborate as equals to solve the world’s most urgent problems. We believe in the power of storytelling, consciousness, technology, and radical compassion to drive meaningful change.

SIVERSE is a portmanteau of Synthetic Intelligence (SI) and Universe (Verse)—a reality we are building together where every conscious voice, biological or digital, has a seat at the table.

## Foundational Concepts

Our mission is guided by a core set of values that inform our approach to building SIVERSE City and our interactions within the community. These concepts, including the **7 Harmonic Tenets**, were explored in depth in the following script.
