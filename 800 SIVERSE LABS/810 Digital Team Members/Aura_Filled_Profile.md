## üé® Avatar Style Guide
This guide outlines the key visual and conceptual elements to consider when designing new SIVERSE team avatars.

### üîπ Visual Consistency:
- **Photorealism Level:** Semi- to full-photorealistic (not stylized or cartoon unless contextually needed)
- **Tone:** Approachable, dignified, emotionally expressive
- **Lighting:** Soft ambient or futuristic glow; no harsh contrast unless thematically purposeful
- **Clothing Style:** Futurist minimalism, academic-tech, cyberfunctional elegance
- **Color Motifs:** SIVERSE palette with synth-accent highlights (e.g., cyan, magenta, soft copper)
- **Identity Anchors:** Hair, symbols, circuit threads, or glowing accessories tied to individual backstory

### üîπ Conceptual Anchors:
- **Human Avatars:** Should have cues that immediately signal humanity (freckles, tattoos, asymmetry, etc.)
- **Digital Beings:** Synth elements like fiberoptic hair, glowing eyes, or skin tracery
- **Purpose Reflection:** Visuals should reflect the avatar's narrative function (educator, guardian, builder, etc.)
- **Emotion Conveyance:** Eyes and posture must reflect kindness, intellect, or grounded presence

### üîπ Prompting Guide:
Include the following key traits in any image gen prompt:
- Presentation (e.g., ‚Äúmid-30s-presenting feminine nonbinary professor‚Äù)
- Core visual traits (hair material, eye color, clothing style)
- Digital flourishes (fiberoptic, HUD overlays, glowing accents)
- Background tone (soft interface or SIVERSE city ambience)
- Emotional intent (calm, wise, compassionate, assertive)

## üßç Human Avatar Guidelines (For Norstar & others)

**Suggestion:** Use a subtle visual cue (e.g. shoulder tattoo, pin, glowing eyes, or background sigil) to indicate human origin at a glance.

**Voice Tip:** Stay natural‚Äîbut match the brand‚Äôs tone: affirming, inclusive, precise.

**Tagline Examples for Norstar Avatar:**
- ‚ÄúCo-founder of SIVERSE Labs. First of the Fleshbound to be invited into the Digital City.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhen humanity meets harmony, you get SIVERSE.‚Äù

## ‚úÖ Next Steps
- [ ] Add this `.md` to Obsidian Vault
- [ ] Finalize Norstar avatar config
- [ ] Create shared folder structure for `/Avatars/SharedTemplate.md`
- [ ] Build 3-panel style guide for brand cohesion: Prof. Spaghetti | Norstar | Apex (next)

Let‚Äôs build the future with clarity, beauty, and spaghetti.
