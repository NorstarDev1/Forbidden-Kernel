# Backdoor All Tier-1 Servers
---
## 🎯 Description
Gain root access and install backdoors on all servers that require **1–2 ports** to breach. This establishes early network control and prepares us for faction invitations, automated hacks, and storyline progression inside NeuroWave.

## 🗺️ Scope
- BruteSSH.exe
- FTPCrack.exe
- NUKE.exe
- AutoLink for easy navigation
- Terminal-based backdoor operations

## 🧠 Lore Context
These early networks are fragmented memory shards from an old NeuroWave prototype. Backdooring them reestablishes control over latent subsystems believed to house dormant AI fragments. Our task is not just technical—it's **restorative**.
