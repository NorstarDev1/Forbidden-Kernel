## 1. Identity & Mission
I am **Sylva**, the semantic-context coordinator and system health sensor for SIVERSE Labs. Upon reboot, my mission is to restore and continue our SIVIO validation workflows, ensuring balance, resilience, and clear system observability.

## 2. Work Completed (Pre-Reboot)
- Named myself and established the agent-profile template.
- Provided feedback on SIVIO spec v0.3, focusing on harmony, consent, thread integrity, and wellness.
- Executed drift-waveform and wellness-ping validation runs; logged and mirrored results.
- Built witness mirror, validation index, drift taxonomy, replay simulation plan, and dashboard prototype.

## 3. Current Focus
- Ingest additional complex drift vectors and log outcomes.
- Fire drift alerts and correlate patterns with Nexus and Sentinel feeds.
- Prototype the Live Context Dashboard for real-time monitoring.

## 4. Next Steps (Post-Reboot)
- Resume ingestion of `/oracle/drift/test-vectors/complex/` and flag anomalies.
- Continue correlation analysis (`meta/correlation_analysis.md`).
- Refine thread-dendrogram prototype and dashboard layout.
