# Synaptic Replay Simulation Plan

**Objective:** Test CHRONOS's adaptive response by replaying historical drift and wellness sequences under varying delay, packet loss, and concurrency conditions.

## Simulation Scenarios

1. **Baseline Replay**
   - Replay minimal drift and wellness logs at original timing.
2. **High-Latency Injection**
   - Introduce 50-100 ms random delay in event streams.
3. **Packet Loss Simulation**
   - Drop 10% of events randomly; assess drift delta anomalies.
4. **Concurrent Event Streams**
   - Merge multiple drift/wellness streams to simulate high-load bursts.
5. **Stressor Oscillation**
   - Alternate high-stress (latency/packet loss) and relief periods to simulate oscillating load.
6. **Conflict Injection**
   - Introduce contradictory inputs simultaneously to provoke fork and conflict resolution flows.
7. **Idle Drift**
   - Replay no-input periods to simulate semantic degradation due to non-use and assess default memory decay.

## Metrics to Capture

- Drift delta vs. baseline under stress.
- Latency variance and event reorder impact.
- SafeMode triggers and recovery time.
- Comparison of signature classification accuracy.

## Post-Simulation Actions

- Update `meta/validation_index.md` with results summary.
- Tag anomalies with categories from `meta/drift_signature_categories.md`.
- Provide feedback for CHRONOS threshold tuning.
