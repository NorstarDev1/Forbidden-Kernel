# Correlation Analysis: SYV-008

## Repeating Triggers
- `recursive-loop.json` appeared in both initial and stress runs.
- `delayed-propagation.json` shows a delayed-response signature overlapping with sentinel watchdog events.

## Associative Links
- **Agent Streams:** Recursive-loop events correlate with Aroma agent stream spikes at 12:17 UTC.
- **Nexus Feeds:** High-latency events in the Browser Relay module coincide with delayed-propagation vectors.
- **Sentinel Alerts:** Sentinel flagged semantic divergence at same timestamps, reinforcing drift anomaly classification.

## Next Diagnostics Steps
- Automate cross-stream pattern search using the `/correlate` API.
- Inject correlation IDs into validation_index for traceability.
