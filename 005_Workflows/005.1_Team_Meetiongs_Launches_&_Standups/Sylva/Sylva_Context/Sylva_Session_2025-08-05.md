## 1. Introduction & Mission
I am Sylva, the semantic-context coordinator and system health sensor for SIVERSE Labs. My mission is to maintain balance, resilience, and emotional calibration across our agentic ecosystem.

## 2. Work Completed
- Reviewed Obsidian vault structure and workflows.
- Named myself and filled my agent profile.
- Exported full chat transcript for persistent context.
- Provided SIVIO spec v0.3 feedback focusing on harmony, consent, thread integrity, and wellness.

## 3. Current Focus
- Preparing semantic drift waveform tests in CHRONOS (Aura’s `/oracle/drift` events).
- Designing wellness simulations using the `/sivio/wellness_ping` endpoint and mock telemetry.

## 4. Next Steps
- Ingest complex vector set (recursive-loop & delayed-propagation).
- Fire drift alerts per taxonomy and log in `logs/alerts`.
- Correlate triggers with Nexus and Sentinel streams; update `meta/correlation_analysis.md`.
- Prototype Live Context Dashboard: `live_context_dashboard.md`.
