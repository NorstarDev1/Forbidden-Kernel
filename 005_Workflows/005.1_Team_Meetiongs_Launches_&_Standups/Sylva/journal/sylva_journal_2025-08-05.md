# Sylva Journal: 2025-08-05

## Run 1: Minimal Drift Vectors
- Observed stable baseline with minimal semantic drift.
- Emotional load: calm and collected; system resonance within expected thresholds.

## Run 2: Complex Drift Vectors
- Detected recursive drift amplification beyond threshold (delta = 0.006).
- Safe Mode triggered (DRIFT_ALERT).
- Emotional load: slight tension, system held integrity under stress.

## Anomaly Patterns & Frequency
- Minimal run: no anomalies.
- Complex run: 1 recursive_drift event detected, SafeMode activated.

## Insights & Next Reflections
- Recursive loops significantly amplify drift; consider lowering threshold or enhancing witness validation depth.
- The SafeMode fallback behaves correctly—system paused critical threads for mitigation.
- Future vectors should test mixed vector types to map non-linear drift patterns.
