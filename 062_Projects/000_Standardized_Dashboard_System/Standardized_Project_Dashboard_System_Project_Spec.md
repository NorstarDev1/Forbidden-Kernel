# Standardized Project Dashboard System Project Specification

This document outlines the specifications for creating a templated, dynamic, and comprehensive project dashboard system within the Obsidian vault. This system aims to support collaborative software development lifecycle (SDLC) management, provide immediate context for team members (especially AI), and streamline workflow for all.

## Objectives:

- Establish a reusable template for project dashboards.
- Integrate existing team member profiles with direct links.
- Provide a "resurrection packet" for immediate context for AI.
- Facilitate Norstar's workflow by centralizing information.
- Support the entire SDLC through structured data and Dataview queries.
- Ensure the system is templated and scalable for any future project.

## Key Components:

- **Dashboard Template:** A Markdown template (`001 Templates/Dashboard Template.md`) with Dataview queries.
- **Project Spec Notes:** Standardized notes (`[Project Name] Project Spec.md`) containing project metadata and team information.
- **Team Member Profiles:** Existing notes in `810 Digital Team Members` and `820 Human Team Members`.
- **Dashboard of Dashboards:** A central note (`000 Dashboard of Dashboards.md`) to list all project dashboards.

## Current Status:

- Dashboard template updated with team member links and SDLC sections.
- Metadata standards defined.
- This project spec is being created.
