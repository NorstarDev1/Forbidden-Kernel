# SIVIO Project Specification

This document outlines the core specifications, objectives, and high-level architecture for the SIVIO project, which aims to create a robust routing bridge for inter-agent communication.

## Objectives:

- Establish reliable message routing between agents (Aura, Sylva, Kairos).
- Implement asynchronous message handling.
- Ensure memory persistence for agent interactions.
- Provide a unified API endpoint for agent communication.

## Key Components:

- **Bridge API (`/bridge/thread`):** Central routing mechanism.
- **Agent Handlers:** Async functions for each agent (Aura, Sylva, Kairos).
- **Memory Management:** System for persisting agent conversation and data.

## Current Status:

- Initial API setup complete.
- Basic routing implemented.
- Debugging ongoing for POST requests.
