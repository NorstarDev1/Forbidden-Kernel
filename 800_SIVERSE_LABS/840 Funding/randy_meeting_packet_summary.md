### ‚ö° Strategic Paths Forward (Based on Meeting Outcomes)

| Outcome from Randy | Path Forward | Notes |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| **Loan approved as-is** | Proceed with funding, finalize Matt‚Äôs ownership docs & IRS update. | Initiate workstation order, start SDR contracts, deploy funds as scoped. |
| **Loan approval delayed until credit re-check in Sept.** | Maintain status quo, continue prepping valuation & internal structuring. | Avoid filing ownership until clearer credit score is known. |
| **Loan at risk due to ownership uncertainty** | Explore safe alternatives: microloans, revenue-based financing, BenFranklin.org bridge funding. | Prepare leaner scope with updated budget to support smaller ask. |
| **Randy recommends valuation and CPA before approval** | Begin valuation process immediately; use results to refile loan or secure bridge capital. | Ask Randy for recommended professionals. |
| **Matt's credit makes him ineligible post-closing** | Shift to external co-guarantor, restructure cap table, or pivot to non-SBA funding. | Have an investor-ready SAFE note template prepped. |

### üîê Internal Priorities
