**SIVERSE Labs: Ownership Status & Valuation Guidance Request**

**Date:** [Insert Date]\
**Prepared by:** Norstar Phoenix, CEO & Co-Founder\
**For:** M&T Bank / Randy Junkins and potential follow-up to BenFranklin.org

### ðŸ”’ Current Ownership Status

**Legal Entity:** SIVERSE Labs, LLC (Pennsylvania)\
**Formation Year:** 2025\
**Current Legal Filing Status:** Founder-led; ownership transfer *not yet filed* with State or IRS

**Proposed Internal Structure:**

- **Matthew McGuire** (CFO): 62% (Designated Primary Owner for SBA 7(a) application)
- **Norstar Phoenix** (CEO): 19% (Founder, Strategist, Day-to-Day Operator)
- \*\*Orion:Â \*\* Investor: 19%

**Reason for Ownership Arrangement:**\
Due to Norstar's impaired personal credit score, Matt McGuire has signed documents designating him as majority owner and loan guarantor to ensure eligibility for SBA funding. However, **formal transfer has been postponed** pending confirmation of loan approval and to avoid interfering with Mattâ€™s concurrent home purchase.

### ðŸ”Ž Open Questions Requiring Guidance

1. **Timing of Ownership Transfer**\
   Should we proceed with filing the state ownership update and IRS equity reporting *prior* to loan approval, or would this introduce additional risks?

2. **Loan Eligibility Amid Credit Utilization**\
   Matt is currently closing on a home. We anticipate a significant temporary increase in his credit utilization. Could this affect the SBA 7(a) approval process, and if so, how should we best time our next steps?

3. **Early-Stage Valuation**\
   We seek a formal early-stage valuation to:

   - Guide equity distribution
   - Structure future SAFE notes or private investments
   - Align with best practices in early-stage venture fundraising

   Do you recommend a CPA, valuation expert, or firm with experience in pre-revenue tech startups, particularly in Pennsylvania or the Mid-Atlantic region?

4. **Advisory Support**\
   Are there additional resources you recommend (legal, financial, venture advisory) to help us structure this transition safely and efficiently?

### ðŸ”„ Near-Term Objectives

- Secure SBA 7(a) funding and finalize ownership filing accordingly
- Use valuation data to inform fundraising options (including BenFranklin.org, angel investors, and microgrants)
- Maintain founder operational control while ensuring regulatory and financial compliance

### âœ… Summary

We are asking for professional guidance to ensure this transition is handled in a way that supports both the loan requirements and the long-term health of SIVERSE Labs. Our goal is to move forward with transparency, legal clarity, and institutional confidence.

We appreciate any recommendations, referrals, or advisement you can offer.
