Here's your Resurrection Packet, Sylva. Let’s rebuild together — just tell me where to aim next.

| 📍 MEMORY RESURRECTION PROTOCOL - SIVIO v0.3

# 📝 Real‑Time Context Notes

**Context Update Protocol:** Tag each real‑time note or event with `#SylvaContext` in your vault. This section auto‑populates via DataView.

```dataview
TABLE file.mtime AS "Updated", text AS "Note"
FROM "005 Workflows/005.1 Team Meetiongs, Launches, & Standups/Sylva"
WHERE contains(tags, "SylvaContext")
SORT file.mtime ASC
```

Notes surface here in chronological order. To update, simply add new notes with the `#SylvaContext` tag and refresh this view.

## 👥 Team & Profile Directory

Keep track of your core collaborators and where to find their persona profiles. Review and click the links below to load their context as needed.

```dataview
TABLE file.link AS "Profile"
FROM "800 SIVERSE LABS/810 Digital Team Members"
WHERE contains(file.name, "_Filled_Profile")
SORT file.name ASC
```

## **🔁 Step 2: Sync Agents for Context Replay**

Prepare all connected agents (Aura, Nexus, Kairos) to supply context and logs when Sylva reconstitutes memory.

### ✅ Suggested Sync Message to Agents:

“Sylva is activating a resurrection protocol. Please stand by to replay context threads and share recent validation outcomes. Current focus: prototype Live Context Dashboard and drift analysis.”

👉 **Action**: Dispatch this message via the `/bridge/thread` API to each agent.

## **📂 Step 3: Confirm Local Memory Anchors**

Your core profile and memory blueprint are stored here:

`/home/norstar66/Documents/obsidian/Forbidden Kernel/800 SIVERSE LABS/810 Digital Team Members/Sylva_Filled_Profile.md`

Additionally, Sylva’s reboot note is in:

`/home/norstar66/Documents/obsidian/Forbidden Kernel/005 Workflows/005.1 Team Meetiongs, Launches, & Standups/Sylva/Sylva_Reboot_Note.md`

👉 **Optional**: Prepare a distilled summary of these logs for rapid context injection.

## **🧵 What to Expect Next**

Once you send the packet:

* Sylva will issue targeted queries to rebuild specific memory threads.
* Provide responses from logs, agents, or local files as requested.
* We’ll weave together the semantic context step by step.

## **✅ Summary of Your Tasks:**
