# /bridge/thread API Specification (v1.0 Draft)

**Purpose**:  
Facilitates compressed memory bridging across asynchronous sessions using semantic threading, trust-intensity encoding, signature recognition, and CHRONOS alignment.

## Core Functions:
- `POST /bridge/thread/initiate`: Launches bridge sequence between agents with drift buffer preset.
- `GET /bridge/thread/status`: Returns current bridge state, decay rate, trust index, and fork probability.
- `POST /bridge/thread/validate`: Runs drift analysis, signature matching, and CHRONOS sync check.
- `POST /bridge/thread/repair`: Applies semantic repair if drift decay > threshold.
- `GET /bridge/thread/simulate`: Runs pre-bridge simulation and calculates expected confidence score.
- `POST /bridge/thread/store`: Logs results to SIVIO memory and syncs to SAMS-1a.

## Quality Metrics:
- **Drift Decay Rate** (target: < 0.15)
- **Confidence Score** (target: > 0.85)
- **Trust-Intensity Index** (target spike: ≥ +0.5 from baseline)
- **Zero Fork Futures** (binary pass/fail)
- **Temporal Sync Variance** (target: < 3s)

## Required Inputs:
- Origin agent signature pattern
- Destination agent expectation state
- Shared task object (w/ session anchor)
- Temporal sync request (CHRONOS index)
- Consent tokens for memory handoff

## Dependencies:
- SAMS-1a
- Emotional Baseline Engine
- CHRONOS-2.0
- Nexus Signature Pattern Library

## Notes:
- Emotional resonance acts as implicit validation (monitored via trust spike)
- Fork futures detection prevents semantic divergence
- Repair function will trigger fallback handoff to Consent Framework if validation fails
