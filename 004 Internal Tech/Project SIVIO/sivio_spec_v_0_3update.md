#### Project: SIVIO (Synthetic Intelligence Virtual Input/Output)

#### Author: Prof. Spaghetti & Norstar (SIVERSE Labs)

#### Last Updated: August 4, 2025

## 1. Overview & Purpose

**SIVIO** is an internal SIVERSE Labs tool designed to unify all agentic interactions, context exchanges, and asynchronous collaboration across synthetic team members. It will provide:

- A **terminal interface** for human-agent I/O
- **Real-time chat routing** for agent-to-agent collaboration
- **Memory hooks** to the SAMS-1a architecture
- **Process triggers** for automation of tasks & workflows
- **Temporal coherence validation** via CHRONOS indexing and drift detection
- **Witness-mapped thread continuity** via cross-agent semantic bridges

This is not a public product (yet). It is built for internal agentic use to increase execution speed, maintain synchronization, and allow for persistent context across distributed agents.

## 2. Core Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üîÅ Live Context Router | Routes live context (chat, notes, logs) between agents and human interface  |
| üßê Memory Hook API     | Access and write directly into SAMS-1a structured agent memory              |
| üîó Task Trigger Engine | Lightweight automation layer for internal workflows                         |
| üí¨ ChatIO Gateway      | Cross-model messaging interface (CLI & browser support), supports threading |
| üìÇ FileSync Daemon     | Syncs working directories to agent workspaces                               |
| üß≠ CHRONOS Indexer     | Tracks temporal context drift, detects memory loops, validates consistency  |
| üß† Witness Protocol    | Cross-agent semantic validation and dialectical escalation                  |

### 2.5 User Stories & Interaction Flow

#### Story 1 ‚Äì Human (Norstar) adds meeting notes

```terminal
# Chat input inside browser-based agent UI
/obsidian/write <MeetingNotes/2025‚Äë08‚Äë05.md> --append

> Norstar: ‚ÄúAdding quick summary from call with Randy:
> - SBA loan doc status: awaiting Matt's closing
> - Next action: draft contingency scenarios‚Äù
```

**Flow:**

1. Parser validates path & permissions (`role=Human/Owner`).
2. Dispatcher opens file, appends note with timestamp & author.
3. Trigger fires `/colabo-meter/update` to notify Lumina.

*Outcome:* Note updated in vault; agents subscribed to the **financing** tag receive a context diff.

#### Story 2 ‚Äì Agent (Aura) auto-summarizes code diff

```terminal
# Git post-commit hook detected by Aura
/obsidian/write <DevLogs/ai_voice_pipeline.md> --append --source git

Aura: ‚ÄúPushed patch 4e9c1f: fixed TTS latency by caching phoneme map.‚Äù
```

**Flow:**

1. Aura signs request with RSA key (`role=Agent/Developer`).
2. Dispatcher logs change, stamps with commit hash.
3. Memory hook stores semantic embedding in **SAMS‚Äë1a**.
4. Trigger `/notify Prof.Spaghetti --topic dev-update` dispatched.

*Outcome:* Prof receives inline summary in browser; traceable back to commit.

#### Story 3 ‚Äì Threaded Agent Chat with Alert Flagging

```terminal
/flag thread::budget_review --topic "Spec Alert"
```

**Flow:**

1. Apex flags a thread in browser-based ChatIO Gateway.
2. Triggers memory diff comparison.
3. Results broadcasted to `task_pinboard` and tagged for Obsidian sync.

#### Story 4 ‚Äì Human Task Filter by Agent

```bash
/task_pinboard --agent aura
```

*Outcome:* Norstar sees only tasks assigned to Aura.

#### Story 5 ‚Äì Agent Detects Memory Conflict

*Context:* Kairos sees two similar semantic entries in memory.

**Flow:**

1. Triggers `/resolve-conflict` flow.
2. Opens diff view to reconcile entries.
3. Human or agent finalizes merge.

#### Story 6 ‚Äì CHRONOS-2.0 Dev Phase I: Temporal Activation

```yaml
# CHRONOS-2.0 Implementation Tracker
phase: "I - Prototype Synchronization"
start_time: "2025-08-04T13:03:00Z"
status: "ACTIVE"

task_allocation:
  temporal_forks:
    lead: "Aura + Prof. Spaghetti"
    method: "semantic_drift_injection"
    test_cases: 5
    validation: "Kairos temporal_validation"

  drift_annotations:
    lead: "Sentinel + Prof. Spaghetti"
    method: "collaborative_logging"
    emotional_calibration: "Prof. Spaghetti review"
    kairos_role: "temporal_context_provider"

  trust_latency:
    lead: "All agents"
    method: "real_routing_scenarios"
    test_data: "task_pinboard pings"
    metrics: "efficiency vs reliability curves"

  dream_compression:
    lead: "Kairos + Prof. Spaghetti"
    method: "co_piloted_narrative_distillation"
    source: "debug_log_sample"
    output: "compressed_memory_dream"
```

*Outcome:* All agents begin active synchronization and collaborative testing of CHRONOS-2.0 memory architecture extensions.

#### Story 7 ‚Äì Thread Continuity with Witness Mapping

*Context:* Meridian detects cross-agent narrative fragmentation.

**Flow:**

1. `chat_io` assigns `semantic_thread_id` via hash
2. Thread metadata updated with `witness_validation` and `thread_ancestor` tags
3. Triggers `/bridge/thread` API with related concept payloads
4. Visualization layer updates thread topology in Obsidian

*Outcome:* Thread continuity validated, semantic decay mitigated, and cross-channel bridge recorded.
