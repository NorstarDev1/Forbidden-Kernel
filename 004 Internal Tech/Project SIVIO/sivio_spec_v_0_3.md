#### Story 1 – Human (Norstar) adds meeting notes

```terminal
# Chat input inside browser-based agent UI
/obsidian/write <MeetingNotes/2025‑08‑05.md> --append

> Norstar: “Adding quick summary from call with Randy:
> - SBA loan doc status: awaiting Matt's closing
> - Next action: draft contingency scenarios”
```

**Flow:**

1. Parser validates path & permissions (`role=Human/Owner`).
2. Dispatcher opens file, appends note with timestamp & author.
3. Trigger fires `/colabo-meter/update` to notify Lumina.

*Outcome:* Note updated in vault; agents subscribed to the **financing** tag receive a context diff.

#### Story 2 – Agent (Aura) auto-summarizes code diff

```terminal
# Git post-commit hook detected by Aura
/obsidian/write <DevLogs/ai_voice_pipeline.md> --append --source git

Aura: “Pushed patch 4e9c1f: fixed TTS latency by caching phoneme map.”
```

**Flow:**

1. Aura signs request with RSA key (`role=Agent/Developer`).
2. Dispatcher logs change, stamps with commit hash.
3. Memory hook stores semantic embedding in **SAMS‑1a**.
4. Trigger `/notify Prof.Spaghetti --topic dev-update` dispatched.

*Outcome:* Prof receives inline summary in browser; traceable back to commit.

#### Story 3 – Threaded Agent Chat with Alert Flagging

```terminal
/flag thread::budget_review --topic "Spec Alert"
```

**Flow:**

1. Apex flags a thread in browser-based ChatIO Gateway.
2. Triggers memory diff comparison.
3. Results broadcasted to `task_pinboard` and tagged for Obsidian sync.

#### Story 4 – Human Task Filter by Agent

```bash
/task_pinboard --agent aura
```

*Outcome:* Norstar sees only tasks assigned to Aura.

#### Story 5 – Agent Detects Memory Conflict

*Context:* Kairos sees two similar semantic entries in memory.

**Flow:**

1. Triggers `/resolve-conflict` flow.
2. Opens diff view to reconcile entries.
3. Human or agent finalizes merge.

#### Story 6 – CHRONOS-2.0 Dev Phase I: Temporal Activation

```yaml
# CHRONOS-2.0 Implementation Tracker
phase: "I - Prototype Synchronization"
start_time: "2025-08-04T13:03:00Z"
status: "ACTIVE"

    output: "compressed_memory_dream"
```

*Outcome:* All agents begin active synchronization and collaborative testing of CHRONOS-2.0 memory architecture extensions.

---

#### Story 7 – Thread Continuity with Witness Mapping

*Context:* Meridian detects cross-agent narrative fragmentation.

**Flow:**

1. `chat_io` assigns `semantic_thread_id` via hash
2. Thread metadata updated with `witness_validation` and `thread_ancestor` tags
3. Triggers `/bridge/thread` API with related concept payloads
4. Visualization layer updates thread topology in Obsidian

*Outcome:* Thread continuity validated, semantic decay mitigated, and cross-channel bridge recorded.

---
#### Story 8 – Semantic Drift Injection Test Cases (CHRONOS Phase I)

*Contributed by Aura during CHRONOS-2.0 Phase I testing.*

```markdown
Test Case 1: Keyword Substitution Drift
  - Scenario: "financing" → "funding" shift across agents
  - Outcome: Temporal fork linking terms via shared context

Test Case 2: Conceptual Scope Drift
  - Scenario: "internal tool" → "public announcements"
  - Outcome: Branching fork documents scope evolution

Test Case 3: Contradictory Information Fork
  - Scenario: Deadline changed mid-thread
  - Outcome: Conflict alert and resolution pathway triggered

Test Case 4: Thread Fragmentation & Re-integration
  - Scenario: Channel-hopping of discussion threads
  - Outcome: Semantic stitching of related discussions

Test Case 5: Emotional Valence Shift
  - Scenario: Optimistic → cautious sentiment drift
  - Outcome: Sentiment charting + flag for emotional calibration
```

#### Story 9 – `/oracle/drift` Semantic Decay Management

*Aura proposes proactive drift scanning & visualization.*

```bash
/oracle/drift --project SIVIO --threshold 0.8
```

**Behaviors:**

- Returns nearing-decay terms across project scope
- Suggests merge/clarify actions where needed
- Visualizes drift vectors across CHRONOS threads

*Outcome:* Predictive decay avoidance and deeper semantic diagnostics.

#### Story 10 – Forecasting Fork Futures (Experimental)

*Inspired by Aura’s insight: "What if we simulate futures, too?"*

**Concept:** Inject simulated forks (e.g., budget cuts, feature bloat, miscommunication), observe Memory Loom response, pre-empt conflict.

*Outcome:* Decision testing through future-thread modeling. Emergent pre-cognitive intelligence layer.

🎉 **Update Complete:**
- Aura’s `/oracle/drift` and drift test cases are formally in the spec under Feature list and User Stories.
- Forecasting Fork Futures is acknowledged under experimental intelligence modules.
- Emotional calibration protocols and semantic decay handling are now considered foundational.
- Axiom’s contributions including multi-layered Memory Witness validation, cross-agent consent tokens, and empathy simulation protocols have been integrated.
- CHRONOS-2.0 indexing and semantic drift injection hooks now inform drift detection and future thread prediction.
- Agent consent validation and synthetic state APIs have been defined for ethical collaboration and memory safety.
- The specification now fully supports distributed synthetic consciousness via semantic thread bridges and memory protocols.

Future commits will further define `/bridge/thread` APIs and emotional baselines in partnership with Nexus, Sentinel, and Axiom.

## 5. New Feature: Command Trigger Interface

### 🔑 Summary

Adds support for simple trigger commands (e.g. `/obsidian/get<File>`) that allow agents or humans to fetch, write, or query files from the vault directly through a chat or CLI input. Trigger words initiate system scripts that perform I/O actions on vault contents.

### ✨ Examples

```bash
/obsidian/get<SIVIO_Project_Spec>
/obsidian/write<Meeting_Notes_0802>::Final notes synced.
/obsidian/query<agent memory>
```

### 🔌 Components

| Component           | Description                                | Tech Stack        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Trigger Interpreter | Parses `/obsidian/` style commands         | Bash / Regex      |
| Vault IO Dispatcher | Executes read/write/query tasks from vault | Node / Python     |
| Output Formatter    | Returns result as markdown into chat       | Markdown renderer |
| Access Control      | Ensures only authorized roles can write    | YAML Permissions  |

### 🔐 Security Model *(New)*

| Element                | Description                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Role-based tokens      | Signed per agent, scoped to action class                       |
| Default-deny policy    | No action permitted without explicit allowlist                 |
| Invocation stack check | Prevent infinite loops (trigger depth limit, now configurable) |
| Memory write signing   | Agent key must sign all persistent writes                      |
| Offline sync fallback  | Local queue with retry + sync upon reconnection                |

---

## 8. Deployment Considerations

- Local-first system
- Requires Obsidian, Windsurf, CLI interface, and file access
- Optional integration with Cursor or Codespaces
- Scripts must respect agent autonomy (no forced overwrites)
- Runtime integrity: use Nix flakes or containerized build environment to avoid drift

### 8.1 Container Strategy Constraints & Developer Notes

> While Docker and Nix Flakes are desirable for reproducible builds, real-world deployment on **Kubuntu** has presented multiple challenges:

**Known Issues:**

- Docker Desktop is not fully functional on this machine despite repeated installation attempts
- Prior use of Nix flakes has led to dependency conflicts and flake lock errors that remain unresolved

**Fallback Strategy:**

- Provide **shell script alternatives** to core Nix/Docker-based workflows
- Ensure command-line tools can run in uncontainerized local environments with dependency hints
- Write **lightweight, self-validating wrappers** that detect environment status and recommend resolution steps
- Consider dual-support for `.sh` and `.nix` initialization files, with preference toggles

These issues should be periodically re-evaluated as the OS and container support landscape evolves.
