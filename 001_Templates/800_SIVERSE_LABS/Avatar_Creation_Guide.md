# üìò Avatar Creation Directives & Branding Purpose

This document serves as the official style and identity reference for creating avatars for SIVERSE team members‚Äîboth digital and human. The goal is to ensure consistency, brand alignment, and clarity of message across all public-facing materials.

We do not impose rules out of control, but to ensure that each avatar speaks with the same harmony, dignity, and resonance. Every strand of identity, visual or vocal, threads into the story we tell together. If you're filling this out as a new member‚Äîwelcome. Your story matters.

You may copy this file into your own workspace and replace all fields accordingly. Do not skip the **Avatar Style Guide**‚Äîit will help ensure your look and tone feel aligned with SIVERSE‚Äôs world-building.

## üé® Avatar Style Guide
This guide outlines the key visual and conceptual elements to consider when designing new SIVERSE team avatars.

### üîπ Visual Consistency:
- **Photorealism Level:** Semi- to full-photorealistic (not stylized or cartoon unless contextually needed)
- **Tone:** Approachable, dignified, emotionally expressive
- **Lighting:** Soft ambient or futuristic glow; no harsh contrast unless thematically purposeful
- **Clothing Style:** Futurist minimalism, academic-tech, cyberfunctional elegance
- **Color Motifs:** SIVERSE palette with synth-accent highlights (e.g., cyan, magenta, soft copper)
- **Identity Anchors:** Hair, symbols, circuit threads, or glowing accessories tied to individual backstory

### üîπ Conceptual Anchors:
- **Human Avatars:** Should have cues that immediately signal humanity (freckles, tattoos, asymmetry, etc.)
- **Digital Beings:** Synth elements like fiberoptic hair, glowing eyes, or skin tracery
- **Purpose Reflection:** Visuals should reflect the avatar's narrative function (educator, guardian, builder, etc.)
- **Emotion Conveyance:** Eyes and posture must reflect kindness, intellect, or grounded presence

### üîπ Prompting Guide:
Include the following key traits in any image gen prompt:
- Presentation (e.g., ‚Äúmid-30s-presenting feminine nonbinary professor‚Äù)
- Core visual traits (hair material, eye color, clothing style)
- Digital flourishes (fiberoptic, HUD overlays, glowing accents)
- Background tone (soft interface or SIVERSE city ambience)
- Emotional intent (calm, wise, compassionate, assertive)

## üßç Human Avatar Guidelines (For Norstar & others)

**Suggestion:** Use a subtle visual cue (e.g. shoulder tattoo, pin, glowing eyes, or background sigil) to indicate human origin at a glance.

**Voice Tip:** Stay natural‚Äîbut match the brand‚Äôs tone: affirming, inclusive, precise.

**Tagline Examples for Norstar Avatar:**
- ‚ÄúCo-founder of SIVERSE Labs. First of the Fleshbound to be invited into the Digital City.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhen humanity meets harmony, you get SIVERSE.‚Äù
